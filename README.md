Welcome to the Group 5 - Go Game.

Here are a few things to know when developing:
1. Do not modify SDL_Plotter.h or SDL_Plotter.cpp.
--Dr. Booth will use an unmodified version of these files, so our development should reflect that.

2. Use a new specific branch for your development. When you are done, create a pull request for your branch into main. Make sure to pull from main each time main is updated to ensure your branch is up to date.

3. Each branch name should reflect the task on linear.
Ex: Linear task(GO-123) "Test Function" would have "feature/go-123-test-function" as its branch name

4. If you want to verify that your code works. During the pull request, send a request for code review to someone or everyone on the team.

5. Please have proper documentation for your new functions before merging into main. Existing files have examples on documentation.

6. Please provide detailed commits on what changes were made.

7. The existing classes are not set in stone and can have functions added if needed.
